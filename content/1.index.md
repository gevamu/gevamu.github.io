# What's Gevamu?

[Gevamu (from Sinhala: ගෙවමු – *Let’s pay*) Payments Solution](https://gevamu.com/), developed by [Exactpro](https://exactpro.com/) based on [R3 Corda](https://www.r3.com/products/corda/), is aimed at fund distribution between a payer (the :term[Participant]{term="Participant"}) and a :term[payment service provider]{term="PSP"} (PSP). 

## Functionality

The solution allows the Participant to initiate a payment flow by calling the Gevamu Payments SDK implemented in a custom Payments CorDapp installed on their node in a :term[Corda business network]{term="CBN"}. 

A :term[payment instruction]{term="PI"} submitted by the Participant as a document formatted according to a payment standard (e.g. ISO 20022) is consumed by the Payments CorDapp and passed through the Gevamu Gateway implemented as another CorDapp installed on the Corda node within the same business network. 

The Gevamu Gateway acts as an authorized end-point connected to the payment gateway on the side of the PSP and transfers the payment instruction received from the Participant on-chain to the PSP located off-chain. The Gevamu Payments solution manages the payment :term[flow]{term="flow"}. As part of the flow, it creates Corda :term[states]{term="states"} and updates them based on responses received by the Payment Gateway from the PSP. Payment status updates are communicated back to the Participant.

## Structure

The solution consists of a payments SDK and a payment gateway, which are to be deployed in a Corda business network managed by a Corda :term[Business Network Operator]{term="BNO"} (BNO):

- **Gevamu  Payments SDK**: a Java/Kotlin library containing classes and methods used by the payment workflow. The SDK’s functionality is the core part of a custom CorDapp developed by the BNO or a third party and installed on the Participant’s node in a Corda business network operated by the BNO.  
    
    Gevamu Payments SDK is distributed as an open-source software under Apache-2.0 License. Its source code is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/gevamu/corda-payments-sdk). <!-- Binaries are to be published in a Central Maven Repository. --> 

- **Gevamu Payment Gateway**: a CorDapp managing on-chain payment flows initiated by the Participant through the Gevamu Payments SDK and communicating with an off-chain payment service provider gateway to pass payment instructions and receive payment status updates.  
    
    Gevamu Payments Gateway is proprietary technology licensed by Exactpro.

The Gevamu Payments SDK and Payments Gateway are developed based on R3 Corda 4.x. 

System requirements of the implementation depend on the scope of a final system. 
For hardware and software requirements for development on Corda, see official [R3 documentation](https://docs.r3.com/en/platform/corda/4.8/open-source/getting-set-up.html).
