# Application

The Gevamu payments solution has been developed to be used within, but not limited to, the following domains:

- payment infrastructures
- exchanges and central counterparties
- DLT-based and hybrid platforms
- financial standards and protocols
- asset classes: fiat, digital assets (including CBDCs and NFTs)

## Example: Payments ecosystem

The diagram below illustrates a use case of Gevamu Payments solution being integrated into a hybrid DLT/non-DLT payments ecosystem.

![Sample implementation schema](/img/Sample_implementation.png)

In the sample configuration proposed on the diagram, the Gevamu payments solution (Payments SDK and Payments Gateway) interacts with the following components:

### Client Application

Typically, the Client Application is a Web UI or a mobile application on a user’s machine. It is developed by the Participant/BNO organization and customized according to their needs. The Participant provides essential payment information and initiates the payment process in the UI of the Client Application. Subsequently, the Gevamu Payments SDK and Payments Gateway will handle the payment initiation process.

### Middleware

Middleware is a backend to enable communication between the Client Application and the Participant Node in the Corda Network. The payment data specified by the Participant, through the Client Application, is translated into the payment instruction and sent to the Payments CorDapp. 

::notice{info}

A sample Client Application UI along with middleware is developed by Exactpro. In this implementation, the middleware communicates with the Client Application via REST API; its communication with the Payments CorDapp is done via Corda RPC. The source code of both sample components is available as a [supplementary part of the Payments SDK](https://github.com/gevamu/corda-payments-sdk/tree/master/payments-app-sample).

### Corda network

A Corda network is a collection of nodes with a vetted, unique identity that share a common “root of trust” upon which all certificates and signatures are ultimately chained back to. Its subset (business network) is managed by the BNO. In the context of the payment solution described here, such a network hosts the Corda nodes where both parts of the Gevamu solution are deployed as CorDapps.

### Participant node

The Participant node is a node in the Corda business network with the Payments CorDapp installed on it. 

### Payments CorDapp

The Payments CorDapp is a custom CorDapp developed by the Participant or the BNO using the Gevamu Payments SDK. 

### Gateway node

The Gateway node is a node in the Corda business network where the Gevamu Payments Gateway is installed.
Each Gevamu Payments Gateway is custom-written to work with a specific PSP and every payment initiation request requires that the gateway be specified.
Therefore, with minimal changes, the App using the Payments SDK can connect to different PSPs.
The Gateway node communicates on-chain with the Participant’s CorDapp based on the Gevamu Payments SDK via a proprietary API; the connection with the PSP is off-chain.
  
### PSP payments gateway
The PSP payments gateway is an endpoint of a proprietary off-chain payments solution on the PSP side.
