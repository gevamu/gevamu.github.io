# Examples

This section contains examples of how to use the various features of the Gevamu Payments Solution.

## Architecture

Abstract CorDapp will be used as a sample to demonstrate possible architecture of your app integrated with the Gevamu Payments Solution.

```

Examples describe different methods in sample `GevamuFacade` class. This class implements facade pattern and provides a simple interface to the Gevamu Payments Solution.

```mermaid

  class GevamuFacade {
    + sendPayment()
    + registerParticipant()
    + getPayment()
    + queryPayments()
  }
```

## Template

In order to have access to Corda flows and services, `GevamuFacade` class should be implemented as Corda service.

Read more about Corda services implementation in [Corda documentation](https://docs.r3.com/en/platform/corda/4.7/enterprise/cordapps/api-service-classes.html).

```kotlin
import net.corda.core.node.AppServiceHub
import net.corda.core.node.services.CordaService
import net.corda.core.serialization.SingletonSerializeAsToken

@CordaService
class GevamuFacade(private val serviceHub: AppServiceHub): SingletonSerializeAsToken() {
    // Here goes the implementation of the GevamuFacade class
}
```
