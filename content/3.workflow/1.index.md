# Workflow

Within the use case example introduced in the [Application](/content/application) section, the Gevamu Payment solution supports the following business flows:

1. [BNO onboarding](/workflow/BNO-onboarding): registration of the Gevamu Payments Gateway with the PSP.
2. [Participant onboarding](/workflow/partipant-onboarding): registration of a Participant in the BNO network and with Gevamu Payments Gateway.
3. [Payment initiation](/workflow/payment-initiation): a process initiated by the Participant and handled by Gevamu solution.

::notice{info}

While the Payment Initiation flow is specific to the business use case described in the [application example](/content/application), the BNO and Participant Onboarding flows are generic to most implementations of the Gevamu Payment Solution.
