# 2. Participant onboarding

::notice{info}
  
  Prerequisite: The Participant has installed a custom CorDapp developed by the BNO or a 3rd party and enhanced with the functionality added by Gevamu Payment SDK.

::

To onboard the Participant, the following steps are performed:

1. The Participant requests to join the Payments network.
2. Gevamu Payments Gateway provides the Participant with the Network ID, assigns them a Participant ID, and registers the Payments CorDapp.
3. Network ID and Participant ID are displayed in the Client Application.

4. (Off-Chain) To access the payments service, the Participant registers with the PSP directly by submitting the combination of the Network ID and Participant ID received from the Payments Gateway.
